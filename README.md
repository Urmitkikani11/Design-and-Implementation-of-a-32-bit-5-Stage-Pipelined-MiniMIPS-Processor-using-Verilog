# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-32-bit-5-Stage-Pipelined-MiniMIPS-Processor-using-Verilog
A 32-bit 5-stage pipelined miniMIPS processor implemented in Verilog. The pipeline consists of Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB) stages. Includes hazard detection, forwarding, and control logic. Simulated using ModelSim for validation.
